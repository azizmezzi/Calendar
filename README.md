# Rendering Events on a Calendar

This project allows for the rendering of events on a calendar while avoiding visual overlap. The implementation meets two constraints:

- Every overlapping event should have the same width as every event it overlaps
- Every event should use the maximum width available while satisfying constraint 1

## Usage

To use the app, you will need to follow these steps:


- Install Node.js and npm on your computer if they are not already installed.
- Clone the project from its repository on a version control platform such as GitHub.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies for the project.
- Once the installation is complete, run the command `npm start` to start the app on your local server.
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
- The app should display a calendar with events rendered on it.
